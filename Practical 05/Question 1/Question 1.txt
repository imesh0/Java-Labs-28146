The public static final keyword may or may not be used when declaring the variable. 
The distinction between these two methods is that if the variable is declared using 
the public static final keywords, it is treated as a constant and its value cannot be modified. 
The variable becomes a regular variable and its value can be modified if it is declared without 
these keywords.

2.

The abstract keyword is required when declaring an abstract method.Without the abstract 
keyword, it becomes a regular method and requires an implementation, which you must supply. 
Any class that implements the interface is required to implement any method that has no 
implementation, known as an abstract method.

Since variables in an interface are static and final by default, changing the value 
of x inside this method won't affect the value of x in the interface. As a result,
once initialized, they cannot be modified.
