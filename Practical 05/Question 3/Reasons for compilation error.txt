Due to two problems, the provided code will produce a compilation error:

1. The 'final' keyword is used with the method 'display()' in the 'Student' class to indicate that this method cannot be overridden in any subclass. 

2. The'marks' variable in the 'Student' class likewise uses the 'final' keyword. As a result, "marks" becomes a constant that cannot be altered or updated. 

By removing the 'final' keyword from the 'display()' method in the 'Student' class, you may resolve the compilation problem and enable the method to be inherited by the 'Undergraduate' class.
